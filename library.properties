sentence=Treacle is a library for 'flooding' small machine-to-machine messages over multiple communications paths from a microcontroller.
paragraph= The initial intention is to allow multiple ESP32s to communicate using ESP-Now/UDP/LoRa/MQTT interchangeably to abstract out the communication method from another of my libraries, [m2mMesh](https://github.com/ncmreynolds/m2mDirect). It is most definitely a work in progress.
