# Treacle

Treacle is a library for 'flooding' small machine-to-machine messages over multiple communications paths from a microcontroller.

The initial intention is to allow multiple ESP32s to communicate using ESP-Now and LoRa interchangeably to abstract out the communication method from another of my libraries, [m2mMesh](https://github.com/ncmreynolds/m2mDirect).

It is most definitely a work in progress.

## Why treacle?

I was thinking about 'flooding' packets and the phrase 'from a trickle to a flood' popped into my head, and treacle is a homophone of that.
